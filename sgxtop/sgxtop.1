.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ragged-right and no hyphenation
.na
.nh
.PP
Intel's SGX extensions allow the creation of userland enclaves, protected
from both kernel and low-level hardware access.
.PP
.B sgxtop
provides a real-time view of the list of enclaves running on the system,
their resource usage, and the overall enclave resources usage.
.B sgxstat
provides a quick one-time display of enclaves and statistics
(essentially a snapshot of
.B sgxtop
output).
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
.B sgxtop
and
.B sgxstat
start out by displaying the number of enclaves current running,
and the total number of enclaves created since the driver was started.
This is useful for monitoring overall usage -- large numbers of
enclaves created might indicate an issue with enclaves failing.
.PP
Below that, we track page-ins and page-outs per second.
.B sgxstat displays only snapshot information, so does not show this
information.
.PP
Then, the utilities
display the Enclave Page Cache (EPC) memory usage.
The total available enclave memory
is rather limited, as this space is dedicated to SGX, and cannot be used
by the rest of the system, even when no SGX enclaves have been created.
The total memory available is displayed, then the free memory, then the
memory in use, and finally the memory dedicated to the version arrays in
use (each page swapped out records eight bytes of integrity data, so the
more pages are swapped out, the more VA memory is in use).
.PP
Finally, we list the enclaves running on the system.  We show the
process id (one process can have multiple enclaves -- for instance,
Intel's aesm service requires two), the requested size (always powers
of two), the actual pages added to the enclave (always less than or
equal to the size), the resident memory dedicated by SGX to the enclave,
and the process command name (shortened by the kernel).
.PP
The resident page count can change dramatically if multiple enclaves are
in use.  The SGX driver pages out the oldest memory, so that enclaves
are quickly stripped of their memory, and new enclaves grab lots of
memory.
